# 10k.club - IRLRPG Documentation

Welcome to the 10k.club documentation - your comprehensive guide to the In Real Life Role Playing Game (IRLRPG) where members contribute to real-world business opportunities.

## What is 10k.club?

10k.club is an innovative IRLRPG (In Real Life Role Playing Game) where users play specific roles to contribute to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Members submit USD $10,000 in cryptocurrency to join the exclusive club, with a maximum capacity of 10,000 members, allowing the DAO to accumulate up to $100,000,000 in crypto assets.

- Real Estate development and conversion

- Manufacturing businesses (like chocolate factories!)
- And many other value-generating opportunities
